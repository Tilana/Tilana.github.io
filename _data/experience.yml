   I've been working with HURIDOCS to support human rights defenders with technology. In order to make machine learning and natural language processing accessible to human rights organizations, I built state-of-the-art tools to extract, filter and connect relevant information in large document collections. My responsibilities included the communication of our methodology and results to external partners. Intenmally, I laid the foundations for a conceptual understanding of machine learning with its possibilities and limitations and helped to integrate it into the long-term strategy of HURIDOCS.
