In the winter semester 2022/2023 I teach *Data journalism in Python - A practical introduction into programming*. It's a course for students in the Journalism Master programme at Leipzig University. 

The course covers the basic syntax of Python, with a focus on relevant methods for data journalists: data processing, analysis and visualization. We collect data via APIs or scrapers and critically reflect on what information we can really extract from it or which biases might be included. 

My goal is to make this course as applicable and easy accessible as possible.
Therefore, I created a [workbook](https://tilana.github.io/datenjournalismus-in-python/willkommen/intro.html) which includes all theoretic concepts, as well as the practical application we discussed in class. The best of it: everyone can interact with the code and learn how to program in Python.

This is work in progress and I'm eager to develop this further. If you have feedback, please let me know.
