The Studio Bloc Masters are special. It's a boulder competition, however, it's not only professional but for anyone excited about this sport.

I took this special setup to do a data analysis on the qualification round. What is the point distribution? How many female athletes took part? How successful were international climbers?

Besides exploring the data ([Source](https://darmstadt.studiobloc.de/events/sbm/)), I used the opportunity to explore [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) for data visualization and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) to build a scrolly-telling story.
