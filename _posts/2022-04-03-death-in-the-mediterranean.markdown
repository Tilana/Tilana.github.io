TEST TEST TEST 


From October 2019 till March 2020 we had another incredible support: the [Google.org Fellowship](https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/googleorg-fellowship/). This is an  opportunity for Google employees to do full-time pro bono work for up to six months with a non-profit organization.

At HURIDOCS we welcomed seven Googlers supporting our work in making text classification accessible to human rights organisations. Their expertise ranged from user research, project and product management to machine learning, software development and UX design.

During this time of collaboration our project advanced incredibly fast and at the same time we learned a lot in the process.



In two interviews these learnings and reflections are gathered:

- [HURIDOCS staff](https://huridocs.org/2020/06/huridocs-team-members-reflect-on-google-dot-org-fellows-collaboration/)
- [Google fellows](https://huridocs.org/2020/05/google-dot-org-fellows-talk-collaboration-with-huridocs/)
